# ReadmeGenerator
Readme generator for everything you need!


This is a simple application that will allow the user to generate a high quality readme from the command line. It will take in user input such as title, description, license, usage, testing, and quetsions. The application will take those and populate it into a custom README.md file that will appear in the root directory.
